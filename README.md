Create a basic application that allows the user to search for a spell name from the DND JSON Spells.

https://github.com/vorpalhex/srd_spells/blob/master/spells.json

If the JSON’s array has an object that matches name (make sure to lowerCase the input/json for comparison or they can not match due to case sensitivity), print that spell card detail out. if not, tell the user to try again.
